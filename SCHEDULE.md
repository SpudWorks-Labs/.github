On Wednesday, if any of the followin are true, render the day as a regular one.
    Are there any "TODO" comments in the code?
    Is the system updated, and do the scripts work as intended?
    Does the week plan need and extra day of work?
    Do I rate a <5 on the burned-out scale?

Otherwise, just  keep the day mellow.
